          <h2>Father of Indian Constitution</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b> (14 April 1891 â€“ 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates 
            and served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of <STRong>Jawaharlal Nehru</STRong> . Ambedkar was born on <strong>14 April 1891</strong> in the town and military cantonment of <strong>Mhow</strong>. 
            Ambedkar was born into a <strong>Mahar (dalit)</strong> caste, who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.
            By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University. 
            He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. 
            In 1936, Ambedkar founded the <strong>Independent Labour Party</strong>, which contested the 1937 Bombay election.
            Ambedkar served on the Defence Advisory Committee and the Viceroy's Executive Council as minister of labour.
            Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru invited Ambedkar to serve as the Dominion of <strong>India's Law Minister</strong>.
            He was appointed <strong>Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution</strong> for the future Republic of India.
            He dedicated the rest of his life for equality, brotherhood and humanity. 
            He tried his best for the upliftment of the depressed classes.
